# Home Ice
The goal of the project is to create a social networking like site around playing the sport of hockey
## Goals
* Find rinks for new players around them and connect them to players and teams at the rink to play. 
* Send messages out to players within a certain distance from a rink for pickup/public hockey
* GOALIES. Nothing is more annoying than going to open hockey and not having two goalies for a game. I want this site to help rinks line up goaltenders for open hockey sessions so that everyone has a more enjoyable exeperience and more people come back for hockey at that rink.
